This is my attempt at a Javascrtipt calculator

This project was far and away my most challenging endeavor yet.

I wanted to create an application where not only could the user calculate basic algorithms, but, i also wanted values to be able to be stored in the calculator on top of each other like they do in the real world. It was tremendously tough to research how to do so. With that said, getDisplayNumber and updateDisplay were definitely where is spent most of my time debugging.

Another part of the project that was relatively challening was getting CSS grid to compensate for the extra space that the "0" was taking up. The flip side of that struggle though, was getting intimately familiar with chrome dev tools and the documentaiton for grid in general. I feel really confident with grid and dev tools after this project.

All in all, this was one of my favorite projects to do.
